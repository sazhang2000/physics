A simple pendulum consisting of a small objeet of mass m atached to a string of length / has a period T. Apendulum with which of the following combinations of object mass and string length will also have period T ?

| Object Mass | String Length |
| ------------:|-------------:| 
| $\sqrt{2}m$ | $l \over\sqrt2$ | 

1. $2 \pi k_0$
2. $2 \pi \over k_0$
3. $2 \pi \sqrt{k_0}$
4. $2 \pi \over \sqrt{k_0}$
5. $2 \pi \over \sqrt{|k|}$
6. $\pi \omega=\exists\epsilon$

An ojbect moves up and down the _y_-axis with an acceleration given as a function of time _t_ by the expression $a= Asin\omega t$, where _A_ and _&omega;_ are constants. What is the period of this motion?

(A) &omega;         
(B) 2&pi;&omega;        
(C) $2\omega^2A$      
(D) $2 \pi \over \omega $       
(E) $ \omega \over {2\pi} $
